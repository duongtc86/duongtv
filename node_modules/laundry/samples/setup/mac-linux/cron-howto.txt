On a Linux/Mac system, you'll want to run Laundry on an interval.

Run "crontab -e" and use something like this to run the laundry-tick script
every five minutes:

*/5 * * * * /Users/me/laundry/laundry-tick.sh>>/var/log/laundry.log 2>>/var/log/laundry.log

Media downloads rely on the youtube-dl library, which is updated regularly to
keep up with changes on media sites. You can update this daily by doing
"sudo crontab -e" and including this:

30 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/laundry/node_modules/youtube-dl/scripts/download.js
